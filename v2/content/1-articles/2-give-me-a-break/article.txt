Title: Give me a break!

----

Text: You know, I love Sketch, and I love to contribute to the community. But sometimes everything else needs to wait, when there is one thing in life you really want, one thing you totally need to pursue. I'm at such a point right now, which deters me from updating sketchtips like I planned to. Can't say how long this break will take or if I even will come back to publish articles.

But since I totally don't want to abandon sketchtips I'd like to ask the community for help. Is there anybody amongst my dear readers who wants to continue for me a while? If you are interested, just drop me a line.
