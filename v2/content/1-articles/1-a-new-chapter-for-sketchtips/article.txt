Title: A new chapter for sketchtips

----

Text: I’ve been a big fan of Sketch and Christian’s blog since first discovering Sketch 2.0 on the recommendation of a friend who converted from Adobe Illustrator. I’m extremely excited to pick up the mantle and carry this while Christian is on his sabbatical and he indulges other pursuits.

For my initial post, I was going to go talk a little about the team at Bohemian Coding so I reached out to them but Emanuel Sa wrote back:
“Inspiring words? Hehe, don’t get me wrong, but we don’t really develop with that in mind, we’re discussing everything with everyone, twitter, facebook, internally, and that’s what really leads our development, it has no magic steps, it’s just that.
We're not much to give interviews or insights into our process, as it has nothing special to begin with, we just focus ;).”

Honestly, I was initially taken aback somewhat, given that I saw it as a opportunity to connect with their customers (YOU) but once I thought about it more, it makes sense that they actually completely focused on bringing us great updates such as version 3.1.

I’ve reached out to a few interesting groups using Sketch such as Teehan+Lax so hopefully we’ll have some interesting insights soon but in the meantime, my next post will be focused on the improvements in Sketch 3.1.
